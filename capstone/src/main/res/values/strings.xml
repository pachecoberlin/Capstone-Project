        \nHello my name is Pacheco.\n\n
        This App is a collection of some smaller Apps i have created
        while getting my app creation skills up to date. I love to make great Apps with a nice
        User Experience. As of september 2020 this app is made with state of the art
        technologies. But as you know, you never stop learning.\n\n
