# Capstone-Project

This project started as final project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. In the meanwhile it is used as showcases or portfolio to show off my App Development Skillz. Almost every Codeline is written by myself, if not it is declared at the top of the file. Also content which is not created by me, like pictures, is credited in the source code. All third party content is free of use and maybe licensed. All according licenses can be found in the root of the repository at https://github.com/pachecoberlin/Capstone-Project. There you can also find the data privacy agreement.

## Movies

Within this part of the app, the app connects to a movie database and gets dynamically the actual content from it.

## Jokes

In this project, Google Firebase FireStore is used. Users may sign in to publish own jokes,
 readable for everybody. Also a test Google Ads banner is shown. No real advertisement!
 
## Baking recipes

Here static content is used and the Master-Detail-Flow is implemented and a fullscreen mode, while rotating.

## Sandwiches

Static content is shown in two simple layouts

## Wave Recorder 

This uses the microphone to record and store a Wave File on the phone's storage and afterwards it can be played using SoundPool.

# Why this Project

To show Skillz in Android App Development. Use and show of google services, database handling, App permissions, published content, library usage, own library creation, different layout styles, different usages and more. I got skillz with ExoPlayer, but they are not shown yet in here.
